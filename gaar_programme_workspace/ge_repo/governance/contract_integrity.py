"""GE-110a — contract integrity. A corrupted contract is not assessable.

Three classes of corruption were found in the workbook currently sitting in `data/`, all of them
silent, and all of them reaching the assessor as if authoritative:

  A. **Wrong control content.** M1.1 (board and senior management accountability) carries M3.6's
     evaluation elements verbatim. Not a paraphrase — the same string.

  B. **Requirement sentences in the artefact column.** "Post-implementation verification and
     closure or exception handling are required" is a requirement, not a document anybody can
     produce. 26 of 195 controls carry a sentence where an artefact name belongs. The WB-103
     completeness pass matches declared artefacts against scanned documents, so for those 26 it
     is matching against sentences no file will ever be named after.

  C. **Generated material in the authoritative path.** `data/` holds
     `…_requirement_elements_audited.xlsx` — an exported workbook. `write_back` overwrites the
     "Evidence / artifact" column with evidence text, which is almost certainly how (B) happened.
     A file the tool produced became the file the tool reads.

The design decision that matters here is the verdict, not the checks.

    warning → continue        an assessment runs against a contract known to be wrong, and its
                              output looks exactly like an assessment against a good one

    CONTRACT_INVALID          the assessment does not execute

The second is the only one consistent with how the rest of this system already behaves: a failed
assessor call is not a rating of `none`, a bundle below the document floor is NOT_TESTABLE rather
than all-gaps, and a blocked challenge run is not a clean one. "I could not test this" is a
result here. An unassessable contract is the same shape of fact.

Severity is two-valued on purpose. `error` blocks; `warning` does not and never escalates on
volume. A count of warnings that eventually blocks is a threshold nobody chose.

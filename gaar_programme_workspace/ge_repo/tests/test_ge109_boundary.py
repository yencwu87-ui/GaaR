"""GE-109 — the event/control-plane boundary.

One rule, expressed four ways: **the UI may not write to the governance ledger.** It asks
`core.cycle` to, and `core.cycle` decides whether the write is allowed.

Why this needs a test rather than a convention. `core/cycle.py` was extracted precisely to stop
the UI owning the cycle, and its own docstring says a UI is not a control. The extraction
happened; the migration did not, and for months `app.py` called four cycle functions and wrote
`proposed`, `compared`, `challenged`, `note` and `observed` itself. The visible cost was that a
guard written inside a cycle function did not exist for anyone using the app — WB-103's
bundle-hash check sat inside `assess()` and protected nothing until WB-105 made it public.

A boundary that is only a convention is a boundary that has already been crossed.

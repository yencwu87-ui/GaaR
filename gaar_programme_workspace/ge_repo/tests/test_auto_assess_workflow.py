    This used to grep app.py for the string `("AI assessment",`, which pinned the hand-written
    inline step lists in place. Those lists were the defect — three copies that drifted until
    the pill row showed seven steps and the strip below it showed five. The steps now come from
    one projection, so the test asks what the user sees instead of how it is spelled.
